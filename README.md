  # HOW DO I CAST SPELL
  In case you can't figure it out through exploration, players are meant to experiment, explore and discover the spellcasting mechanic.

  First, find out what color you are, you can do this by asking another player to tell you since you cannot look at yourself (you can also multibox by opening the game in several tabs or windows)
	
  Second, find out the keyword for your color, for example, the keyword for RED is "ISHU", the keyword for GREEN is "TIMYAER", etc.

  Third, find out the spell keyword, for example, the word for HASTE is "SIGIVAEL-FAROTH", the word for levitate is "OESURNAVIGG", etc.
 
  Then to cast the spell, you must type in chat a message taht begins with the keyword for your color, a space, and then the keyword for the spell you wish to cast
  You will hear a sound effect if you did this properly.
  Refer to server code for details on keywords.
